An introduction course to hardware and micro processor design offered at the University of Calgary. 
The goal of this project is to design a program that tracks controller movement to be used with a raspberry pi.
The files are designed to be implemented with a rapsberry pi along with a US-100 utrasonic sensor and raspberry pi joystick (MCP3008).
